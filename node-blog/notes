go to startbootstrap.com and then browse all themes and templates
open clean blog and then download it
copy the contents of the .zip folder and paste it in your folder. rename it to ui

then open your command prompt to the folder and type npm int -y
		this initializes npm with all questions answered to yes

type npm install express
		installs express framework

nodemon - npm install nodemon --save-dev
	> installs a package that does not require you to restar server everytime you change some file
	>--save-dev specifies to npm it is only for development process, not as a part of application


	> after you've installed the nodemon, go to package.json
		> under "scripts" near the top, type in "start": "node index.js"
		its going to look like:
				"scripts": {
					"start": "node index.js"	
				},
		> then go to the command and type the name of the command. in this case, 
				npm run start

		after this, your session should start. if it does not, run command prompt in admin mode

Using Edge templating engine
	This helps us in modifying similar code in different pages. For eg. NavBars in different pages. We want to avaoid having to edit same code in different pages, so, we use this concept of templating engine.

	instruction: go to command line and type- npm install express-edge --save

	then follow the instruction in github under usage. its link is https://github.com/ecrmnn/express-edge

	> go to the root folder and create a new directory named views and create a file index.edge. Copy code from index.html(in pages)

	> then go to index.js(root folder) and in app.get('/', (require,response)), type 
		response.render('index')
	instead of the other response with a directory name and such. The final code will be 
		app.get('/', (request, response) => {
			response.render('index')
		})


	layouts:
		create a new folder in the root/views folder named layouts. create a file inside layouts named app.edge. So, it is going to be node-blog/views/layouts/app.edge

		cut and paste all the codes from index.edge into app.edge and delete everything other than navbar, footer, scripts and links. So, you'd delete header, main content, etc etc. then after the navbar code, define a section.
			its syntax is @!section('content')

		then go to index.edge(blank page) and write codes to direct content to the section defined in layout. its syntax is:
			@layout('layouts.app')

			@section('content')

			<h1>dadadadadada</h1>

			@endsection

		follow this step for other pages too. This will create a placeholder for contents in a page with fixed layouts. here, in place of <h1></h1> tags, paset the contents of each page(header and main content) and check to see if it works properly. Change something in the navBar and see if the changes apply to all pages.


		> for unique scripts on each pages, make a differnet placeholder for scripts in app.edge page. name it 		@!section('scripts')

		to redirect the links to routes instead of html links, go to navbar and then change it to the routes in index.js file instead to the *.html links. (/ for home, /about for about...)


MongoDB

installing mongoDB -> npm i --save mongoose

instantiate the new package -> const mongoose = require('mongoose') 

connect the database -> mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/node-js-blog')

create a folder named database in the root and create another one inside it and name it as models. refer to post.js for further information.

Schema is a model for how the database collection is going to be like. It is the structure of the documents in the collection. Each schema will be different. for eg, a schema for posts - PostSchema would be initialized and set up as:
		const PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
			title: String,
			description: String,
			content: String
		})

the model or the schema itself is going to communicate with the database. 


How the page connects to the database? const Post = mongoose.model('Post', PostSchema)



CRUD 

refer to test.js in root folder

install mongodb and robo3t to work with mongodb
after installation, create a new folder for storing db (in this case database/models)
do to mongodb folder and open mongod.exe
open robo3t and create a new connection (localhost with the port number as 27017)

it is using the schema from database/models/post.js    			
it'll create a new dataabse named node-js-test-blog and insert the data in the create command according to the schema
the second part(error, post) will record any errors in the process along with the data of the entry and will display on the console as (error, post) if there is any error. otherwise it'll store the data in the database

go to console and type 'node test.js' to see if it'll work


to add values to the database, create a form (in a separate page called create.edge). 



Body parser package

		npm install body-parser

browser sends POST data in an encoded format we cant understand
this package will give us the data in a way that we can understand
app.use(bodyparser.json()) -> a way for our application to to access/accept json data from browser or api client

to input data in the database, we will need models(database/models).
		app.post('/post/store', (request, response) => {
			Post.create(request.body, (error, post) => {
				response.redirect('/')
			})
		}) 

	browser makes a post request to these endpoints(/posts/store). the model(database/models/Post.js) is going to create a new document using the dat acoming from the browser which is in request.body and then, we are going to response.redirect to the homepage('/').

app.get('/', async (request, response) => {

	const posts = await Post.find({})
	console.log(posts)
	response.render('index', {
		posts
	})
})
this will use our Post model to find all the records in our database. we are going to use async (asynchronous) function since it is more advanced and looks elegant. 

const posts = await Post.find({}) -> will store all the data({}) related to the Post model in posts constant. await will wait until this line of code is completed before moving to the next line.

response.render('index', {
		posts
	}) -> once Post.find({}) is resolved or finds all the records, we are going to pass this in our view. we are going to pass it as a second arguemnt in the render function. it'll have objects of keys we want to pass. here, posts can also be written as posts: posts

this will populate all the data from our database in the posts variable and render it in the index 


Display dynamic data with templating engiene
		up until now we can only get our data in an array. Templating engiene helps us to display data dynamically on our webpages

	go to the index.egde page (it is our home page where we display our data). Then type 
				@each(post in posts) //posts is the name of the key (variable) we store our data in (from index.js)
				post is the name the variable for each object in the post key

				{{ post._id }}		//echo out post._id. This can be anything. check index.edge for the html tags 

				@endeach

we changed the dynamic link to website in thie field above between @each.....@endeach


now we can see the id in the homepage. No go to post.edge and on title, description and content enter {{post.title}}, {{post.description}} and {{post.title}}. This'll bring content from database. But, we have not passed these contents yet.

go to index.js and modify posts as :
			app.get('/post/:id', async (request, response) =>{
				const post = await Post.findById(request.params.id)
				response.render('post', {
					post
				})
			})

	refer to async and await above. Thi'll pass all the data from Post model into post variable which we use to do {{post._id}} or other actions.
